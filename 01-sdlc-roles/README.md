## Overview

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) describes the stages any IT project follows—from gathering requirements through maintenance. As a DevOps engineer, you fit in after design and into implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## Key Concepts

1. **Business Analyst (BA)**  
   - Gathers customer feedback & writes the Business Requirements Document (BRD).

2. **Product Manager (PM)**  
   - Defines vision, prioritizes epics/stories based on business value and feasibility.

3. **Product Owner (PO)**  
   - Translates prioritized epics into actionable stories with acceptance criteria.

4. **Solution/Software Architect**  
   - Creates High-Level (HLD) and Low-Level (LLD) designs for implementation.

5. **Development & DevOps Teams**  
   - Developers implement code.  
   - DevOps provisions infrastructure, containerizes services, and builds CI/CD pipelines.

6. **QA, DB Admin, SRE, Technical Writer**  
   - QA: writes/runs tests.  
   - DB Admin: sets up and maintains databases.  
   - SRE: monitors, sets up alerts, and manages reliability.  
   - Technical Writer: documents features and runbooks.
