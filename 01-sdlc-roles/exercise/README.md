# Exercise: Map a Simple Feature through SDLC

**Task:**  
1. Pick a hypothetical feature (e.g., “Add dark mode toggle”).  
2. Write a one‐paragraph BRD.  
3. Break it into 2–3 epics/stories, and draft acceptance criteria.  
4. Sketch a basic HLD (diagram or bullet list).  
5. Outline the DevOps steps:  
   - Which infrastructure resources you’d provision (VM/VMs, containers, storage).  
   - How you’d wire up a CI/CD pipeline (build → test → deploy).

**Deliverables:**  
- `BRD.md` (in this folder)  
- `stories.md` with epics/stories + criteria  
- `hld.md` sketch  
- `devops-plan.md` outline
