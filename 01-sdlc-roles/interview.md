# Interview Drill: SDLC & Roles

1. **Question:** At which SDLC phase do you first interact with the development team, and what deliverable do you expect from them?  
   **Model Answer:** I engage during **Implementation**, expecting application code and Dockerfiles; I then provision infrastructure and integrate their code into CI/CD.

2. **Question:** How would you handle a story blocked by missing design details?  
   **Model Answer:** I’d mark the ticket **“Blocked”**, add a comment specifying the missing HLD/LLD details, and @mention the Architect/PO to resolve it before proceeding.
